# Amazingly Fast

## User's Goal

The <em>Amazingly Fast</em> users want to play an online game to practice the four arithmetic operations and also exercise their short-term memory.

## Target Audience

<em>Amazingly Fast</em> is targeted to children from 9 to 12 years old although adults are likely to enjoy it too.

## Owner's Goal

The goal of <em>Amazingly Fast</em> is to bring fun to people while improving their arithmetic and memorization skills. 

In each round, the users will need to solve an arithmetic problem, as quickly as possible. They will also need to memorize the previous result, to compare it with the result of the current problem. So it is a mix of arithmetic, memorization and luck. The owner hopes that this mix will bring fun to the users.

- The question each round and the score rules

At each round the user needs to mentally solve a problem and compare the result with the previous one.

A correct answer scores from 10 to 1000 points, depending on how faster it is given.
  
10 point means the user tooks about 10 seconds or more to answer correctly.

1000 points means the correct answer was given in 100 miliseconds or less.

## Testing 

The test approach consisted of validating on different browsers and devices, navigating, scrolling when possible, clicking in every link, changing the size of the viewport and trying to reproduce every scenario a user might come across. This to ensure that the website is working and looking good in all situations.

For a summarized view of the game in different devices and in order not to tire readers of this document, please check below the tests that were also performed by playing the game in each screen inside the <em>Am I Responsive</em> web site.

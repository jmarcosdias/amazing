# Amazingly Fast

## User's Goal

The <em>Amazingly Fast</em> users want to play an online game to practice the four arithmetic operations and also exercise their short-term memory.

## Target Audience

<em>Amazingly Fast</em> is targeted to children from 9 to 12 years old although adults are likely to enjoy it too.

## Owner's Goal

The goal of <em>Amazingly Fast</em> is to bring fun to people while improving their arithmetic and memorization skills. 

In each round, the users will need to solve an arithmetic problem, as quickly as possible. They will also need to memorize the previous result, to compare it with the result of the current problem. So it is a mix of arithmetic, memorization and luck. The owner hopes that this mix will bring fun to the users.
